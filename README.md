Goo is a reflection library written in Go, which provides an abstraction for built-in reflection API in GoLang. Thanks to the abstraction which is provided, it makes reflection easier. Unlike the built-in reflection API,  it is easy to use and understand.

If you want to contribute to the library or find a bug, please report it.
